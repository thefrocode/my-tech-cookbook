# Welcome to My Tech CookBook

The purpose of this repository is to document and consolidate all that I learn as I go through my software engineering journey. I hope that this will be a useful resource for me to refer back to in the future, and also for anyone else who may stumble upon this repository.

The document is divided into different sections each tackling a stage in the software development life cycle. It also include links to any resources that I have found useful.

Welcome Onboard!

## Design

My primary approach to design involves utilizing component libraries that are built upon Tailwind, enabling me to craft the majority of my designs. This saves me the hassle of having to write CSS from scratch.

### React

#### Shadcn - https://ui.shadcn.com/

Technically it's not a component library. It's a collection beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. They've provided CLI commands to initialize the configuration files and add the components to your project. After that you can customize the components to your liking.

##### What I like about it

- Very easy to customize and use. You have direct access to the source code of the components making it easy to add your own styles.

- Components are compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 accessibility guidelines which are a set of guidelines for making web content more accessible to people with disabilities.
