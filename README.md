# Welcome to My Tech CookBook

The purpose of this repository is to document and consolidate all that I learn as I go through my software engineering journey. I hope that this will be a useful resource for me to refer back to in the future, and also for anyone else who may stumble upon this repository.

The document is divided into different sections each tackling a stage in the software development life cycle. It also include links to any resources that I have found useful.

Welcome Onboard!
